Counts number of unique k-mers in a reference and number of k-mers that are not within Hamming distance 1 of another k-mer in a reference.

Set compiler flag "GCCINT128" to enable 128bit int support allowing for counting k-mers with k up to 64 (instead of the default of 32 on normal 64-bit machines)
